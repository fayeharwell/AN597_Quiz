```{r}
library(curl)
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```

### Unfortunately, I could not get this to work. I was trying to use the arrange function, which typically arranges columns in descending order (which for a character would be alphabetical)... I only moderately hate technology and glitches like this...

```{r}
f %>% arrange(first_name,last_name)

f
```
